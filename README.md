# How i build it
I tackled this test going for mobile first as a Responsive Web Design.
Then I focused on the elements and functionalities of the navbar.
Then some sections of the presenting content.
And at the end I jumped to collapse function of the footer links.

# Work that I couldn't able to finish
As i limit my self to 3-4 hours i left a lot of details like:
- Using the correct fonts
- Having the right colors
- The footer is not ready for desktop
- Some missing sections
